# Graph_lab 

This lab practices implementing graph algorithms in C++. 

## Provided files: 
  * Graph.h: define the Graph class
  * Graph.cpp: implemented memeber functions of Graph class
  * Graph_driver_file.cpp: the main() that reads graph (from standard input or file), performs selecetd graph traversal or algorithms as selected by the user.
  * Makefile: for compilation
  * Three sample graph files **directed_graph.txt**, **dressing.txt**, **undirected_graph.txt** each specifying a graph in the format expected by the program.


## Requirement:
  Basic BFS, non-recursive DFS traversal functions have been provided. You are asked: 
  * Implement the DFS() recursively.
  * Add a member function to the Graph class for **is_connected**, testing if node s is connected to node t by a path.
  * Extend or rewrite DFS_Graph() to detect cycle and return topological ordering (if there is no cycle).  


## What to submit: 

submit your Graph.cpp at the following link: 
TBA.
